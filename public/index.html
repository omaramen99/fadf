      <h3>BIM</h3>
      <h4>What is BIM?</h4>
      <p>Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the foundation of digital transformation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. As the leader in BIM, Autodesk is the industry's partner to realize better ways of working and better outcomes for business and the built world.</p>
      
      <h3>Revit API</h3>
      <h4>What is Revit API?</h4>
      <p>Autodesk Revit® provides a rich and powerful .NET API which can be used to automate repetitive tasks, extend the core functionality of Revit in simulation, conceptual design, construction and building management, and much more.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Revit .NET API allows you to program with any .NET compliant language including VB.NET, C#, and C++/CLI. The Software Development Toolkit (SDK) provides extensive .NET code samples and documentation to help you get started developing with the Revit API.</p>

      
      <h3>Autodesk Forge APIs</h3>
      <h4>What is Autodesk Forge?</h4>
      <p>It's a cloud-based developer platform from Autodesk. Access design and engineering data in the cloud with the Forge platform. Whether you want to automate processes, connect teams and workflows, or visualize your data – you can now create those applications and so much more using Forge APIs.</p>
      
      <h3>Digital Twin</h3>
      <h4>What is Digital Twin generally?</h4>
      <p>A digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world physical system or product (a physical twin) that serves as the indistinguishable digital counterpart of it for practical purposes, such as system simulation, integration, testing, monitoring, and maintenance. A digital twin can, but must not necessarily, be used in real time and regularly synchronized with the corresponding physical system. A pragmatic litmus test of the efficacy of digital twin is for a system tester to run a robust system verification & validation test suite on both the digital twin and the physical twin.[1] When the system tester cannot reliably distinguish between the digital twin and the physical twin with a high probability, the former is a bona fide digital twin.</p>
      <h4>What is the relation between digital twin and BIM?</h4>
      <p>BIM processes and digital twin strategies are built on a number of common principles; both are concerned with improving process visibility, aligning stakeholders and supporting planning. But more importantly, they’re both extremely useful for helping teams look at assets not as siloed, capex-focused investments, but instead as ongoing projects.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Successful BIM processes and frameworks help you establish a clear project vision, that supports business outcomes before design commences or work begins on site. But, in order to continuously improve and adapt projects to deliver greater value to everyone once work has begun, you need the real-time insights. That’s where digital twins become extremely useful.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Digital twins allow you to visualise, monitor and optimise your operational assets, processes and resources by harnessing live data. This provides vital, real-time insights into performance and activity. At its core, a digital twin can be an output of a BIM process and is essentially a ‘living’ version of the project or asset view that BIM processes exist to create – able to evolve and transform using real-time data once the asset is in use.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To gain maximum value from every asset at every stage of its definition, design, construction and operation, subsequent capital expenditure projects should contribute to the creation of an ongoing digital twin, again through the BIM process. That twin will act both as a single source of truth for the asset throughout its lifecycle, and as a blueprint for future innovation and improvement – taking a process and elevating it into an evolving project.</p>
